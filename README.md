KetchupLand work-in-progress is a free and open-source 3D open-world adventure sandbox game, built on the Minetest voxel game engine made in the style of old games from the Windows 95 era, complete with 256 color VGA graphics. It is based around you collecting resources to survive the harsh caves, dry deserts, hot volcanoes and freezing tundras of the land of the ketchup, harvesting tomatoes and exploring the vast worlds and beautiful biomes for better resources and tomatoes.

It is possible to play KetchupLand via the latest Minetest version (currently 5.5), but it is encouraged to use the [KetchupLand Launcher](https://ketchupland.github.io/new-site/download).
